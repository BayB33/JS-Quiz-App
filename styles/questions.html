Intro of myself:
Army
End 2019 and started training in 2020
Briefly the things I know by now at this stage of my training;

Ask for his background:
What he did
What training he had 
His carreer;


What's expected from a junior?
Are there any job or activity I could do to acquire experience?
Is there anything he could advise, a particular training, a language or a roadmap, 
anyone who is/was in a similar situation that I can speak with, any remote job I could do
or a company who would recrute juniors with sponsorship in the uk (better yet with a training program).
